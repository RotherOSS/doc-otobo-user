.. warning::
    This feature will be included in one of the next OTOBO releases. If you need it beforehand, please contact sales@otobo.de, we will find a solution.

.. seealso::

   System configuration ``ChatEngine::Active`` needs to be activated to use this feature.

The chat feature allows for chats between agents and customers using the OTRS front end. Once enabled, customers or public users can start chats with agents and vice versa. Finished chats can be archived and attached to tickets, or can be downloaded as PDF by agents, customers and public users.

Each chat is assigned to a chat channel. Chat channels are like chat rooms. Each chat channel is assigned to a certain group which controls the permissions for this channel. If no chat channel is selected when a chat is created, this chat will be created in the *Default channel*.
