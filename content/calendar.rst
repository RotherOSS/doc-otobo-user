Calendar
========

When working with customers, resource planning and scheduling can be a complex task. Appointments enable you to meet your customers where and whenever needed.

OTOBO supports this requirement with calendars. Calendars allow management of appointments and resources inside the ticket system. You can connect your tickets to scheduled tasks and make them available to all users to see. This feature adds transparency to show your team's workload and prevent users from promising resources which are not available.
